I want to express my deepest appreciation to my advisor, Professor Wenchao Li.
During my two-year master's studies, he has always been a great mentor for me. 
He set an example of excellence as a researcher, instructor and role model.
My experiences in his group have always been rewarding. 
Conducting researches under his guidance motivates me to refine my skills and set a high standard for myself. 
I cherish this opportunity for professional and personal development that he has provided me.

I would like to thank my thesis committee members for providing me support through this process. 
Your suggestions and feedback have been invaluable for me.

I also want to thank our department for providing me with such an open and resourceful environment. 
I'm so glad that I will be able to continue enjoying my time here as a PhD student.

Last but not least, I can not tell how grateful I am to my parents.
I would not have been here without your encouragement. You believe in me and always want the best for me.
You are oceans away, yet your love is close.
