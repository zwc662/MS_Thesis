I'm so grateful to my advisor, Professor Wenchao Li.
During my two years' study as a master student, he has always been an great mentor for me. 
He set an example of excellence as a researcher, instructor and role model.
Being accepted into his group brought me an important opportunity for self improvement.
Conducting researches under his guidance motivates me to refine my skills and set a high standard for myself. 

I would like to thank my thesis committee members for providing me so much support through this process. 
Your suggestions and feedback have been invaluable for me.

I also want to thank ECE department for providing me with such an open and resourceful environment. 
I'm so glad that I will be able to continue enjoying my time here as a PhD student.

Last but not least, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my my parents. 
I would not have been here without your encouragement. You believe in me and always wanted the best for me.
You are oceans away, yet your love is close.
