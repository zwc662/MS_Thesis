During my two years' study as a master student, my advisor, Wenchao Li has always
been an great mentor for me. I want to express my sincere gratitude 
to Prof. Li for his guidance during my research. 
In the beginning, when I was seeking for an area of interests, as well as an 
opportunity for personal development, he offered me a choice to join his group, 
which was so precious to me.
When I was involved in the research, I benefited so much from his vision in 
choosing research topics, and learnt so much from the way how he located 
and formulated the research problems. His strictness motivates me to refine 
my skills and set a high standard for myself. 

I want to thank ECE department for providing me with such an open and resourceful environment. 
I'm so glad that I will be able to continue enjoying my time here as a PhD student.
